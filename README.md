# dr
ERE derivative-based regex engine

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jakebailey/dr?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/jakebailey/dr)

This is based on the derivative-based membership checking from Grigorie Rosu's
[CS 598 GR](http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/index.php/CS598_-_Runtime_Verification_(Spring_2017)), aka Runtime Verification.

The implementation is relatively trivial (it's quite literally the same as the paper),
so it might as well be public. The parser was the time consuming part.

"dr" comes from dR, because I think I'm funny.
